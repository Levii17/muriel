# Project Structure Guide

This project must follow a strict directory structure for maintainability and clarity. The main directories are:

- `src/components/` – React components only
- `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks
- `src/stores/` – Jotai atoms (state management)
- `src/types/` – TypeScript type definitions
- `src/data/` – Static data (symbols, etc.)
- `src/utils/` – Pure utility functions
- `src/lib/` – Third-party configurations

**References:**
- See `.cursorrules` for full structure and enforcement
- All new files must be placed in the correct directory according to their purpose
