# Snap-to-Grid Rule for Symbol Placement

All symbol placement on the schematic canvas **must** snap to the nearest 10px grid point. Use the `snapToGrid` utility from [grid-utils.ts](mdc:src/utils/grid-utils.ts) for all drag, drop, and move operations involving symbols. This ensures alignment and consistency with the visual grid defined in the Fabric.js-based canvas implementation.
